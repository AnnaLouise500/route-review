# Route Review App
As a climber I've seen how collaborative this sport can be and how important it is to making progress quickly. People who you've never met before will approach you and give you support and guidance
if you're struggling on a route that's kept you guessing for the past 6 months! To enable greater collaboration and build a broader sense of community I've decided to build a route review application
which will initially allow people to log their feedback on things like; the routes, crags and walk-in conditions to help both experienced and new climbers make informed decisions about their climbing trips.


# Currently:
There are websites out there such as UKC (https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/ousal_dale-24347/push-122602) which allow you to review climbs, and create an online logbook which climbers can use to
document which routes they have completed and when. The downside to UKC's website is that the mobile experience is poor and they have no application available. 

# Top Challenges:

## 1) Reviewing Routes
Each established climbing route globally has a grade assigned to it by the person who first climbed it. Over time this grade may change based off of the collective opinion from every climber who has sent it
since (sent means completed) or whether the route has weathered badly (smaller holds means the climb would get harder!). For these reasons it's important that people get a more up to date evaluation of a
climb that they may be travelling for hours to attempt. Having a central, collaborative, mobile view of these reviews would help people understand that this easy problem listed in their climbing book has actually
become an intermediate problem due to a hold breaking off. It may also be a case that the first person who sent the route was exceptionally strong so graded it as easier than it actually is. Example of a current 
browser based review platform below:

## 2) Tracking progress and knowing which holds to use!
Many times when I have been out climbing with a group of friends, we tend to not get a mobile signal as the locations are quite remote. This means they resort to drawing in their physical guidebooks 
(if they have them - these cost from Â£20 upwards and have up to 700 pages!) to keep a log of which climbs they completed that day. If they dont have a logbook covering the routes they are attempting
then we have to resort to either guessing the route or standing ontop of a high boulder, looking like the statue of liberty trying to catch 1 bar of signal for an internet search. Example of this within a guide book 
below:

## 3) Walk-in Map and Guide
As mentioned previously, some of these crags can be hard to find! Walk-in guides are a complete life saver as they give you a rough idea of which direction to head in, saving the group time and energy
which can then be used working their chosen project/s. As the seasons change, so does the landscape - this has caused issues in the past where the guide books you're using are static, giving you directions
that may be hard (or in our case near impossible) to follow. Seeing a landmark through an overgrown forest is a lot harder in summer than it is in winter when all the vegetation has died back. You also want to be 
able to evaluate whether the area you're headed to is appropriate for the group so you need a list of all the routes and their difficulties available. Example of this within a guide book below:

Do not want people to have the ability to add a route, only contribute to existing records
